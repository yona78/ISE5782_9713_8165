A project about computer graphics that I and Hillel Kroioro made on our fourth year in JCT. This project is used to render geometries in a scene. Simply, you place the geometries, the camera and the light sources, and the program will render it to an image. There are also some great features, like anti-aliasing (smooth the edges of the geometry in the picture) and depth of field (blur the things that aren't in focus.
